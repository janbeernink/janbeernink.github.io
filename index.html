  					&lt;p&gt;If you're familiar with the OmniFaces library, you may know that it contains a number of useful utility methods. Some of these methods would also be&lt;br /&gt;
useful in an environment where adding a dependency on a JSF utility library may not make sense, such as an EJB jar or a more general purpose library.&lt;br /&gt;
That is why we are now announcing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/omnifaces/omniutils&quot;&gt;OmniUtils, a general-purpose utility library&lt;/a&gt; targeting Java 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For current users of OmniFaces nothing will change, while there may be a small overlap in functionality between OmniFaces and OmniUtils, OmniFaces&lt;br /&gt;
will remain a single-jar dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OmniUtils is currently in the very early stages of development and some major changes may still be made. Stay tuned to this blog for further&lt;br /&gt;
information about OmniUtils.&lt;/p&gt;
