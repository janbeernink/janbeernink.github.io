title: Announcing OmniUtils
layout: post

If you're familiar with the OmniFaces library, you may know that it contains a number of useful utility methods. Some of these methods would also be
useful in an environment where adding a dependency on a JSF utility library may not make sense, such as an EJB jar or a more general purpose library.
That is why we are now announcing [OmniUtils, a general-purpose utility library](https://github.com/omnifaces/omniutils) targeting Java 8.

For current users of OmniFaces nothing will change, while there may be a small overlap in functionality between OmniFaces and OmniUtils, OmniFaces
will remain a single-jar dependency.

OmniUtils is currently in the very early stages of development and some major changes may still be made. Stay tuned to this blog for further
information about OmniUtils.
